# Flight_Reservation_System_Using_Threads
I implemented a flight reservation system. This program will be run as multi-threaded by taking the synchronization issues into  consideration. The scenario of the flight reservation system 
is that the clients arrive for seat reservation, and the program reserves the seats for them. In this project, I have used the knowledge of Threads and Semaphores.

# Execution
First, you should have a "gcc compiler" in order to execute the code. And, there is a "Makefile" in the directory in order to run the program. The output file obtains the clients and their assigned seats.
